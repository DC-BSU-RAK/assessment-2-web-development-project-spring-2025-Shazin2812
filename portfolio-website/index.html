        <p>I am Shazin Hussain, a Creative Computing student at Bath Spa University UK, RAK.
        I am skilled in videography, photography, editing, and modeling. 
        My passion lies especially in video editing and modeling. 
        I have experience modeling for caf√©s and have worked on video projects for university programs
        and various shops to support their digital marketing. While I initially focused only on modeling,
        I now actively offer both editing services and modeling.</p><br>
