    <div class="about-info">
    <p>Hi, my name is Shazin Hussain, and I'm a creative enthusiast from the UAE 
    and a student of Creative Computing at Bath Spa University UK, RAK campus. 
    My background is in videography, photography, editing, and modeling, 
    and I like to believe that I bring a mix of technical skills and artistic vision to all my work. 
    My true passion, though, lies in video editing and modeling, having had the opportunity to work with cafes, 
    university programs, and various shops — creating content for digital marketing and brand presence specifically.
    While I started out specializing more in modeling, I now offer a more well-rounded creative service that 
    incorporates editing and visual storytelling with my on-camera work. I’m always excited to collaborate and 
    push boundaries in the creative space.
    </p> <br>
    During my early creative journey, I focused heavily on photography, capturing everything from urban scenes 
    to live events. My work received recognition from Canon, who personally reached out to express appreciation 
    for the quality and creativity of my photos — especially those taken with their camera systems. One of the 
    highlights of my photography career was during Expo 2020 Dubai, where I actively covered the event and shared 
    my images online. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with many people engaging with and praising my work,
    further motivating me to evolve and expand my creative skills.
